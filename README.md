# IoT Temperature Sensor API

A simple REST API created for getting and registering the temperature in my bedroom. 

Feel free to use and/or make any improvements to it. 

I developed this using Restify to create two API methods (GET and POST temperature) and Moment to format the last time that the temperature was updated.
